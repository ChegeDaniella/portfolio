<div class="why">
    <h4>Why Moringa...</h4>
    I had ventured abit into coding while in campus and become interested in learning more.In the process of looking for a good school my friend recommended Moringa School.
    And at around th sametime my parents were also informed of an alumini of Moringa who was able to acquire positive traits. My interest grew more when I visited the website and I was able to
    see the courses you offered and the knowledge that will be impacted on me by the end of the classes.
